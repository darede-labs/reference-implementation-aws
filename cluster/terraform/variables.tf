# ⚠️ DEPRECATED: Variables are now loaded from ../../config.yaml via locals.tf
#
# This file is kept for backward compatibility only.
# All configuration should be done in config.yaml at the repository root.
#
# See config.yaml for:
#   - cluster_name
#   - region
#   - auto_mode
#   - node_groups (instance types, scaling, capacity type)
#   - vpc (create/existing, CIDR, AZs, NAT gateway)
#   - domains and subdomains
#   - tags

# No variables needed - everything comes from config.yaml
